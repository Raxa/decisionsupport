Raxa EMR Decision Support Module

Decision Support Module Goals

1. Create clinical decision support system with Arden rules in back end OpenMRS

2. Expose rules as REST calls (can create and get Arden rules)

3. Verify that Arden rules are run whenever data is modified

4. Send alert messages back the user based on Arden result. Use existing RaxaAlert service.

5. Create front end GUI to REST (GET and POST) in ExtJS

6. Create responses to Arden-generated alerts in the front end in Outpatient module.

Nice-to-haves:

7. Repository of rules

8. Arden in the front end (offline case)

9. Privacy constraints on rules ("Rules of rules")

10. Machine learning rules
